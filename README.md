# Dependencies
* OpenCV 4.8.0

# Testing enviroment
* Windows 10
* Visual Studio 2022
* C++ 14


# Usage
After creating the project with Visual Studio 2022, compile the codes of our method in the project directory, and run ```Source.cpp```.


# Support Vector Machine (SVM)
```train_angle_0729.txt``` and ```train_len_0729.txt``` are our training data for the SVM.

```train_angle_0729.model``` and ```train_len_0729.model``` are the SVM models we have trained.

By default, the trained model will be saved in ```/GH-COOSAC-main/svm_model```.

You can modify the code to change the save directory:
```
svm_save_model(your_path, model);
```
